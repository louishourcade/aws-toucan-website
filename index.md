Hi there! 👋

I’m Alan, a Data Engineer at an Ocean Institute responsible for the sustainability and protection of our oceans. The Shark Control department recently approached me as **they want to analyze the evolution of shark attacks over the last century**. They believe that a better understanding of attack factors will improve the prevention of incidents during aquatic activities.

1. **I need to make sure that the data is permanently accessible by the Shark Control department**. I have seen too many colleagues struggling with their data warehouses, and I want to avoid this trap by using managed solutions.
2. **I need to provide meaningful and user-friendly visualizations** for my colleagues to act upon. I have seen enough complex and non-user centric dashboards in my life!

**🧐 How can I build an available, fully managed, and cost-efficient data warehousing solution? And after that, how can I build an application that provides my non-technical users the information they need to take meaningful decisions?**

I have been scratching my head for a while, until I read [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/build-a-data-storytelling-application-with-amazon-redshift-serverless-and-toucan/) 🤯.

I used this set up to provide the Shark Control department a data story telling application, and they absolutely love it ! 🎉

Want to see the outcome? Look at the following charts
